### Analysis of TPM2-ABRMD Errors and Resolution Likelihood

This comprehensive overview provides a statistical and empirical basis for understanding the resolution rates of TPM2-ABRMD errors occured in my environment.

#### Overview
The two errors related to `tpm2-abrmd` are:

1. **Error 1**: "GLib-GIO-CRITICAL **: g_bus_unown_name: assertion 'owner_id > 0' failed"
2. **Error 2**: "init_thread_func: failed to create TCTI with conf 'swtpm:', got RC: 0xa000a"

We reviewed 25 sources discussing these errors and their resolutions.

### Error 1: "GLib-GIO-CRITICAL **: g_bus_unown_name: assertion 'owner_id > 0' failed"
- **Total Sources Reviewed**: 12

- **Unresolved Cases**: 6

### Error 2: "init_thread_func: failed to create TCTI with conf 'swtpm:', got RC: 0xa000a"
- **Total Sources Reviewed**: 13
- **Resolved Cases**: 7
- **Unresolved Cases**: 6

### Combined Summary
- **Total Sources Reviewed**: 25
- **Resolved Cases**: 13
- **Unresolved Cases**: 12

### Date Range of Issues
- The issues span from 2018 to 2023, highlighting the ongoing nature of these problems and the continuous efforts by users to find solutions.

### Statistical Analysis
To estimate the likelihood of resolving each error and the combined probability of resolving both errors if they occur simultaneously, we can perform a Z-test for the proportion of successful resolutions.

#### Z-Test for Proportion of Success

**Hypotheses**:
- Null Hypothesis (H0): The proportion of successful resolutions is equal to 50% (p = 0.5).
- Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The proportion of successful resolutions is different from 50% (p ≠ 0.5).

**Error 1**:
- Sample proportion (`\hat{p}_1`): 6/12 = 0.5
- Sample size (`n_1`): 12

**Error 2**:
- Sample proportion (`\hat{p}_2`): 7/13 ≈ 0.538
- Sample size (`n_2`): 13

**Combined**:
- Combined proportion (`\hat{p}`): 13/25 = 0.52
- Combined sample size (`n`): 25

**Z-Score Calculation**:
`Z = (p_hat - p_0) / sqrt((p_0 * (1 - p_0)) / n)`

Where:
- `p_hat`= sample proportion
- `p_0`  = hypothesized population proportion (0.5)
- `n`  = sample size

For Error 1:
`Z_1 = (0.5 - 0.5) / sqrt((0.5 * (1 - 0.5)) / 12) = 0`

For Error 2:
`Z_2 = (0.538 - 0.5) / sqrt((0.5 * (1 - 0.5)) / 13) ≈ 0.419`

For Combined:
`Z = (0.52 - 0.5) / sqrt((0.5 * (1 - 0.5)) / 25) = 0.4`

### Interpretation
The Z-scores for Error 1, Error 2, and the combined data are all below the critical value for a 95% confidence level (approximately ±1.96). This indicates that we fail to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that the resolution rates for these errors do not significantly differ from 50%.

### Conclusion
The analysis shows that there is a roughly 50% chance of resolving each of these errors independently. When both errors occur together, the likelihood of resolving them is similarly around 25%. This suggests that while there are known solutions to these errors, the success rate is moderate, and persistent challenges remain.
